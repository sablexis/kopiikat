## About Project
Turning a 2 minute personal task into an overly complex discord bot so I can have it all done for me? Right up my alley! I've set up countless discord servers with a simmilar structure so often that I thought there must be a way to do this quicker & easier...thus came Kopiikat ! Rather than create channel organizers and subchannels yourself ask the cat to do it!
## Project Files Description

## Getting Started
If you'd simply like to add kopiikat to your server [click here!](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1308808583693074454) otherwise, fork this repository and run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install discord js express undici
```

## How the command works
using the slash command structure the user provides a string where whatever is before a colon ':' is a Category label and whatever comes after is a channel label.
Categories and
```
/structure markdown: 'Test Category A' : 'channel-1', 'channel-2' | 'Test Category B' : 'channel-3', 'channel-4'
```

##### Functionality
- Split input by newlines
- Track indentation levels (spaces/tabs before -)
- Create categories first, store their IDs
- Create channels under parent categories based on indentation

## Edge cases &  how they're handled
- Permission errors (blocks entire operation)
  - 
- Invalid characters (causes creation failures)
  - 
- Discord limits (prevents excess channels)
  - 
- Missing quotes (parsing errors)
  - 
- Duplicate names (naming conflicts)
  -
